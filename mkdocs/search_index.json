In addition, due to a lack of single women in the colonies, they were unable to find wives.\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nFearful for another rebellion, the landed gentry of the South (Planter Class) began looking for an alternative source of labor. They settled on Africa, thus sparking the slave trade and the South's dependence on slave labor\n\n\nJamestown\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nJamestown was the first British colony in America, founded in 1607 by the Virginia Company of England\n\n\nCause\n\n\nThe joint-stock Virginia Company founded the colony looking for gold. \n\n\nEffect\n\n\nIts charter guaranteed the overseas settlers the same rights that they would get if they stayed in England. This part of the charter was eventually extended to all of the colonies.\n\n\nPeter Stuyvesant\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nPeter Stuyvesant was a Dutch Directors-General who attacked the Swedish in New Sweden (Delaware).\n\n\nCause\n\n\nAngered that the Swedish trespassed on the Dutch preserves, the Dutch sent Peter to take out the Swedish forces in New Sweden (Delaware).\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nThe colonists of old New Sweden were absorbed into the New Netherlands, and the colony eventually became Delaware)\n\n\nNew England Confederation\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nFounded in 1643 by the colonists of the Massachusets Bay Colonies and the Connecticut Colonies.\n\n\nCause\n\n\nThe Confederation was formed during the English Civil War, in order to defend themselves against the Indians, French, and Dutch. Each colony only had two votes, which angered the populous Massachusets Colony. \n\n\nEffect\n\n\nWhile it was extremely weak and Puritan exclusive, the Confederation was the first considerable milestone to colonial unity. From 1640-1660, when England went through its Civil War, the colonies operated on autonomy, which resulted in a independent culture in the Americas.  The Confederation was disbanded in the 1660s, when King Charles II took power. (Replaced with Dominion of New England)\n\n\nDominion of New England\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nThe Dominion of New England included New England, New York, and East and West Jersey\n\n\nCause\n\n\nIn 1686, royal authority created the Dominion of New England to promote efficiency in the administration of the English Navigation Laws. This was part of an effort by the monarchy to tie the colonies closer to the motherland by restricting trade with only England. The Dominion was lead by Sir Edmund Andros, who heavily taxed the people and enforced the hated Navigation Laws, nearly caused a revolt within the colonies. The Dominion was disbanded after the Glorious Revolution in England of 1689.\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nAs a result of these laws, colonists turned to smuggling and colonists began to share similar sentiments against England.\n\n\nGreat Puritan Migration\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nMost likely a typo for great \"english\" migration.\n\n\nCause\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nThe Half-Way Covenant and the Salem Witch Trials\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nThe Salem Witch Trials were trials held across New England settlements prosecuting 'witches', who were actually mostly women from commerical families.\n\n\nIn the mid-seventeenth century, preachers began preaching jermiads, worried by declining religios devotion. In 1662, ministers announced the \nHalf Way Covenant\n, which was a new form of Church membership that allowed the baptism of non-converted members.     \n\n\nAs a result of expanding Puritan membership, the link between the elect and the others broke, which further diluted the spiritual purity from the original Puritans. This eventually led to the Puritan Church opening its doors to everyone, led to and end of strict religious purity. Also led to an increase of women in the Puritan congregation, who came to make up the majority of churchgoers. This eventually lead into the Salem Witch trials, where most of the accused women came from Salem's growing market economy and the accusers came from the farming families in Salem. They reflected the widening social gaps of New England and the fear that Puritan Heritage was dying out to Yankee commericalism.\n\n\nHeadright System\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nLaw that gave the right to acquire 50 acres of land if you pay the passage of an indentured servant.\n\n\nCause\n\n\nVirginia and Maryland passed this system in order to make it more favorable to bring in indentured servants to work the land, which would increase each colony's economy.\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nThe system greatly benefitted the masters who brought slaves to the New World, and they eventually became the great merchant-planters of the South, also known as the Planter Class. (Washington and many other of the founding fathers belonged to this class).\n\n\nIndentured Servant\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nIndentured Servants were people who boarded ships to America, who voluntarily sold themselves to virtual slavery for a fixed amount of time in exchange for passage to the New World, and (maybe) land after they became free.\n\n\nCause\n\n\nDue to a \"surplus\" of men in England and a growing Tobacco industry in America, a demand for labor was sparked.\n\n\nWhy not African Slaves?\n\n\nSince African slaves were more expensive and morality rates were high in the South (Primarily the Chesapeake), Africans were seen as a bad investment, and so the landowners turned to indentured servants instead.\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nLed to an even more increased reliance on agriculture in the South. Eventually, after Bacon's Rebellion, the planters would turn to African slaves.\n\n\nTriangular Trade\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nCause\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nGeorge Whitefield\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nCause\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nWilliam Pitt\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nCause\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nTreaty of Paris\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nCause\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nAlbany Congress 1754\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nCause\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nMercantilism\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nCause\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nQuartering Act 1765\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nCause\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nCommittees of Correspondence\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nCause\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nSamuel Adams\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nCause\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nStamp Act 1765\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nCause\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nBoston Massacre\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nCause\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nQuebec Act\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nCause\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nJohn Hancock\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nCause\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nBunker Hill\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nCause\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nBattle of Saratoga\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nCause\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nThe Declaration of Independence\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nCause\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nThe establishment of the colonies\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nCause\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nCalvinism-Puritanism\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nCause\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nEthnic, religious, social diversity in the colonies\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nCause\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nImportance of the French and Indian War\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nCause\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nJohn Rolfe\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nCause\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nJohn Smith\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nCause\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nJohn Winthrop\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nCause\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nRoger Williams\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nCause\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nWilliam Penn\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nCause\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nMiddle Passage\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nCause\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nHalf Way Covenant\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nCause\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nFirst Great Awakening\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nCause\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nJonathan Edwards\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nCause\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nBattle of Quebec\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nCause\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nProclamation of 1763\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nCause\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nSalutary Neglect\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nCause\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nSugar Act 1764\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nCause\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nTownshend Acts\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nCause\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nIntolerable Acts\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nCause\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nLexington/Concord\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nCause\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nDeclatory Act 1766\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nCause\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nBoston Tea Party\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nCause\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nThe Association\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nCause\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nThomas Paine\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nCause\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nYorktown\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nCause\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nFirst Continental Congress\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nCause\n\n\nEffect",
