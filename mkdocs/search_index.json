            "text": "Jamestown 1607\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nJamestown was the first British colony in America, founded in 1607 by the Virginia Company of England\n\n\nCause\n\n\nThe joint-stock Virginia Company founded the colony looking for gold. \n\n\nEffect\n\n\nIts charter guaranteed the overseas settlers the same rights that they would get if they stayed in England. This part of the charter was eventually extended to all of the colonies.\n\n\nThe Establishment of the Colonies\n\n\nThe South\n\n\n\n\nFirst Colony: Jamestown, Virginia\n\n\nMaryland: Catholic Haven formed by Lord Baltimore\n\n\nCarolina founded in 1670\n\n\nGeorge created as buffer colony\n\n\nSouthern Colonies\n\n\nAll dependent on agriculture\n\n\nPracticed Slavery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe North\n\n\n\n\nFirst Colony: Plymouth Bay Colony, in Massachusetts\n\n\nGreat English Migration causes 70,000 to come to Americas, 20,000 form MA\n\n\nRhode Island formed by Roger Williams\n\n\nNew Netherlands -\n New York\n\n\nPennsylvania formed by Penn\n\n\n\n\nCalvinism-Puritanism\n\n\nOverview\n\n\n1517: Martin Luther nails his 95 Theses -\n John Calvin of Geneva founds Calvinism, which becomes the religion of the Puritans. \n\n\nKing Henry VIII breaks from Catholic Church, wants to keep same customs, but Puritans in England believe they should \"Purify\" the Anglican Church into Calvinism. A group of Puritans, the Seperatists, break away entirely from the Church -\n Form Plymouth\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nPuritans founded the New England and Massachusetts Bay Colonies and dominate Connecticut.\n\n\nEthnic, religious, social diversity in the colonies\n\n\nOverview\n\n\n\n\nSwedes in Deleware\n\n\nGermans were 6% of the population, and came fleeing war\n\n\nmostly Lutheran Protestants\n\n\nmostly in Pennsylvania\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScots-Irish, 7% of population\n\n\ncame for tolerant Pennsylvania\n\n\nfound that the best land was already taken by the Germans and Quakers\n\n\npushed out and attacked Indians for land, became first frontiers\n\n\nvery rebellious group of people, and were anti-Native American\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiversity by Colony\n\n\n\n\nPuritans were the least ethically diverse.\n\n\nMiddle Colonies were diverse (many different white immigrants)\n\n\nSouth displayed its historic black-and-white composition\n\n\n\n\nJohn Winthrop\n\n\nThe Massachusetts Bay Colony's first Governor.  \n\n\nOverview\n\n\nVery religious, propelled Massechusetts as a beacon to humanity and a model, religious society. Made the colony one of the biggest and most influential of the New England Outposts. Made Massachusetts into a fur trading, fishing and primarily, shipbuilding industry powerhouse.\n\n\nRoger Williams (Founded Rhode Island in 1635)\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nPopular Salem minister who challenged the Bay Colony's charter and Puritan values.\n\n\n\n\nDenied authority of civil government to regulate relgious behavior (the fundemental construct of Puritan society)\n\n\nChallenged the colony's stealing of land from Indians\n\n\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nKicked out of Massachusetts in 1635, Williams fled to the Rhode Island area in 1636, and built a Baptist church. Established complete freedom of religion, even for Jews and Catholics. Demanded no oaths regarding religous beliefs, no taxes for a state church, and even sheltered the Quakers.\n\n\nAlso gave universal suffrage (though property requirements eventually were added).\n\n\nMade Rhode Island as the most liberal and advanced of all settlements in the New World and Old World alike.\n\n\nWilliam Penn (Founded Pennsylvania in 1681)\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nQuaker Englishman who founded the colony of Pennsylvannia in 1681. Bought land from Indians (as opposed to stealing, like most other colonies) and organized his cities. Had an unusually liberal regime included a representative assembly elected by landowners. There was no tax-supported church, and freedom of religion was granted to all settlers, though England forced Penn to deny Catholics and Jews the right to vote or hold office. There was no military, no restrictions on immigration, and naturalization was an easy process. The Quakers disliked slavery and Pennsylvania promoted a modern atmosphere giving economic opportunity, civil liberty, and religious freedom. \n\n\nJohn Smith\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nCaptain John Smith was an early savior of the Virgina colony. He turned the inital colonists from gold hungry colonists to look for food and start farming.\n\n\nJohn Rolfe\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nFather of the tobacco industry and the economic savior of Virginia. Also husband to Pocahontas.\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nBy 1612, Rolfe had perfected methods of raising tobacco, and started selling it to Europe. Soon, the demand became so strong that almost all colonists switched to growing tobacco and began looking for more land. This led to more expansion against Native American land. Also led to higher demand for labor, which was first supplied by Indentured Servants, and eventually (after Bacon's Rebellion), African slaves.\n\n\nBacon's Rebellion 1676\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nBacon's Rebellion was a rebellion in 1676 led by Nathaniel Bacon.\n\n\nCause\n\n\nThe rebellion consisted of freedmen (ex-indentured servants) who were angry that they didn't get the land that they migrated for. In addition, due to a lack of single women in the colonies, they were unable to find wives.\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nFearful for another rebellion, the landed gentry of the South (Planter Class) began looking for an alternative source of labor. They settled on Africa, thus sparking the slave trade and the South's dependence on slave labor\n\n\nPeter Stuyvesant\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nPeter Stuyvesant was a Dutch Directors-General who attacked the Swedish in New Sweden (Delaware).\n\n\nCause\n\n\nAngered that the Swedish trespassed on the Dutch preserves, the Dutch sent Peter to take out the Swedish forces in New Sweden (Delaware).\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nThe colonists of old New Sweden were absorbed into the New Netherlands, and the colony eventually became Delaware)\n\n\nNew England Confederation 1643\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nFounded in 1643 by the colonists of the Massachusets Bay Colonies and the Connecticut Colonies.\n\n\nCause\n\n\nThe Confederation was formed during the English Civil War, in order to defend themselves against the Indians, French, and Dutch. Each colony only had two votes, which angered the populous Massachusets Colony. \n\n\nEffect\n\n\nWhile it was extremely weak and Puritan exclusive, the Confederation was the first considerable milestone to colonial unity. From 1640-1660, when England went through its Civil War, the colonies operated on autonomy, which resulted in a independent culture in the Americas.  The Confederation was disbanded in the 1660s, when King Charles II took power. (Replaced with Dominion of New England)\n\n\nDominion of New England 1686\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nThe Dominion of New England included New England, New York, and East and West Jersey\n\n\nCause\n\n\nIn 1686, royal authority created the Dominion of New England to promote efficiency in the administration of the English Navigation Laws. This was part of an effort by the monarchy to tie the colonies closer to the motherland by restricting trade with only England. The Dominion was lead by Sir Edmund Andros, who heavily taxed the people and enforced the hated Navigation Laws, nearly caused a revolt within the colonies. The Dominion was disbanded after the Glorious Revolution in England of 1689.\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nAs a result of these laws, colonists turned to smuggling and colonists began to share similar sentiments against England.\n\n\nGreat Puritan Migration\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nMost likely a typo for great \"english\" migration.\n- look into that\n\n\nThe Half-Way Covenant and the Salem Witch Trials 1660s\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nThe Salem Witch Trials were trials held across New England settlements prosecuting 'witches', who were actually mostly women from commerical families.\n\n\nIn the mid-seventeenth century, preachers began preaching jermiads, worried by declining religios devotion. In 1662, ministers announced the \nHalf Way Covenant\n, which was a new form of Church membership that allowed the baptism of non-converted members.     \n\n\nAs a result of expanding Puritan membership, the link between the elect and the others broke, which further diluted the spiritual purity from the original Puritans. This eventually led to the Puritan Church opening its doors to everyone, led to and end of strict religious purity. Also led to an increase of women in the Puritan congregation, who came to make up the majority of churchgoers. This eventually lead into the Salem Witch trials, where most of the accused women came from Salem's growing market economy and the accusers came from the farming families in Salem. They reflected the widening social gaps of New England and the fear that Puritan Heritage was dying out to Yankee commericalism.\n\n\nThe Great Awakening (1730s-1740s)\n\n\nCause\n\n\nIn the early 18th century, religion was sagging in the colonies. The Puritans in particular, were fighting against liberal ideas that suggested that not just the 'elect' get to go to heaven. \nArminianism\n, the theology preached by Jacobus Arminius, preached that an individual's free will determined a person's eternal fate, and that all humans, not just the elect, could go to heaven if they accepted God's grace. A few Puritan churches accepted this, leading into more emotional packed sermons, also known as the \nGreat Awakening\n.\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nThe Awakening's emphasis on direct, emotional spirituality damaged the authority of the older clergy, who had relied on their education for their authority. This lead to many more different churches and schisms in the religion. It also lead to the creation of American colleges like Princeton and Brown and others to promote higher learning and clergy training. Most importantly, the Awakening was the first mass movement of the American people, that united many of the American people.\n\n\nImportant Preachers\n\n\nJonathan Edwards\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nIgnited the Great Awakening. Believed in salvation through good works and was fairly popular, but was overshadowed by Whitefield 4 years later.\n\n\nGeorge Whitefield\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nGeorge Whitefiled was a famous preacher during the Great Awakening, and represented the ideas of great emotional preaching during the time.\n\n\nHeadright System\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nLaw that gave the right to acquire 50 acres of land if you pay the passage of an indentured servant.\n\n\nCause\n\n\nVirginia and Maryland passed this system in order to make it more favorable to bring in indentured servants to work the land, which would increase each colony's economy.\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nThe system greatly benefitted the masters who brought slaves to the New World, and they eventually became the great merchant-planters of the South, also known as the Planter Class. (Washington and many other of the founding fathers belonged to this class).\n\n\nIndentured Servants\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nIndentured Servants were people who boarded ships to America, who voluntarily sold themselves to virtual slavery for a fixed amount of time in exchange for passage to the New World, and (maybe) land after they became free.\n\n\nCause\n\n\nDue to a \"surplus\" of men in England and a growing Tobacco industry in America, a demand for labor was sparked.\n\n\nWhy not African Slaves?\n\n\nSince African slaves were more expensive and morality rates were high in the South (Primarily the Chesapeake), Africans were seen as a bad investment, and so the landowners turned to indentured servants instead.\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nLed to an even more increased reliance on agriculture in the South. Eventually, after Bacon's Rebellion, the planters would turn to African slaves.\n\n\nTriangular Trade\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nThe trade between New England, Africa, and the West Indies.\n\n\nNew England gave rum, Africa took the rum for slaves, the West Indies gave molasses for the slaves, and the molasses went to New England for more rum.\n\n\nMiddle Passage\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nThe passage where slaves were transported across, in cruel conditions. Africans were mostly sold to Newport, Rhode Island, or Charleston, South Carolina.\n\n\nThe French and Indian War 1754-1763\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nStarted by George Washington in 1754 when he accidentally shot the French Diplomat\n\n\nEffects\n\n\nLed to Britain nearly bankrupting itself, which meant they needed to now tax the colonists. See \nSalutary Neglect\n for more information.\n\n\nAlbany Congress 1754\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nCongress summoned by the British government to (short-term) keep the Iroquois loyal to the British and (long-term) unite the colonies together to create a common defense against the French.\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nAnother attempt for colonial unity, 7/13 colonies showed up.\n\n\nWilliam Pitt 1757\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nAlso known as \"The Great Commoner\", William Pitt was a leader who in 1757 took power in the London government. Pitt's efforts ultimately resulted in victory in the French and Indian war.\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nSee the terms of the Battle of Quebec (Below)\n\n\nBattle of Quebec 1759\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nMarked the end of the French and Indian War. \n\n\nThe Terms\n\n\nThe end of the war resulted in Spain and England taking all of French territory, and England taking Spain, resulting in England as the dominant power in North America and as the leading naval power in the World.\n\n\nMercantilism\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nThe belief that a country's military and political power was measured by its wealth which was measured by the amount of gold or silver a country had. To acquire gold or silver a country needed to \nexport more than it imported\n. Thus, owning colonies were strategic as they could supply raw materials and a guaranteed market to export to.\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nAs a result, the London government treated the Americans as tenants, and initially enforced laws like the Navigation Acts of 1650 to keep colonials only trading with Britain. However, the colonies eventually became so prosperous that the British stoppped bothering to enforce these laws as they were profitting so heavily off of colonial trade. However after the French and Indian War, the British treasury went nearly bankrupt, forcing the British to enforce the laws again. This angered the colonials as they had been used to self-government under British \nsalutary neglect\n.\n\n\nSalutary Neglect 1714-1763\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nA period of time from 1714-1763 when England didn't enforce many of its laws (Navigation Laws and Taxes). Arguably in effect since 1607.\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nThe Americans became increasing self-reliant and resistant to taxes, causing problems after the French and Indian War (1763) when the British needed the colonists to help pay off debt from the war.\n\n\nProclamation of 1763\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nProhibited settlement in the area beyond the Appalachian moutains.\nIssued by the British government in oreder to work out the Indian problem and prevent another revolt like Pontiac's Uprising.\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nAngered Americans who thought they had won that land after winning the French and Indian War and after crushing Pontiac's Uprising, several expanded into prohibitted areas anyways.\n Marked more splitting with British policy by the colonists.\n\n\nActs of 1764 - 1765\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nSugar Act (1764)\n\n\nIncreased duty tax on sugar imported form the West Indies.\nOffenders of this act and the stamp act were forced to appear in \nadmirality courts\n where juries were not allowed, and defendants were \"guilty until proven innocent\"\n\n\nQuartering Act (1765)\n\n\nLaw that forced the colonials (mostly in New England) to house British troops.\n\n\nStamp Act (1765)\n\n\nTax on stamps, mostly effected the wealthy, Samuel Adams incited colonials \"No Taxation without representation\"\nLed to Stamp Act Congress of 1765\n\n\nStamp Act Congress\n\n\n9 colonies sent representatives, decided on \nnonimportation agreements\n against British goods. (Common boycott from the colonies against British goods)\n\n\nDeclatory Act 1766\n\n\nCause\n\n\nAfter withdrawing the Stamp Act, Parliament passed the Declatory Act which reaffirmed Parliaments right to bind the colonies in all cases. Effectively stated that the British government would not tield its control over its colonies.\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nSet the stage of a continuing confrontation between the colonists and the British.\n\n\nTownshend Acts 1767\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nPassed in 1767 by efforts from Charles Townshend.\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nThe Acts added a duty on glass, white lead, paper, paint, and tea. Made the taxes an indirect customs duty. However, the colonists were mostly just angry at being taxed without representation. \n\n\nAlso, since the tax income was meant to be used to pay the salaries of the royal governors (The Americans had long since been controlling Royal Governors through their salaries) the colonists saw this as another attempt to control them. \n\n\nLed to more smuggling and nonimportation agreements (Similar to those passed by the Stamp Act Congress) which lead to the British sending more troops to the colonies to keep law and order. (eventually led to Boston Massacre).\n\n\nSamuel Adams\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nSamuel Adams was a political organizer who led many protests against English taxation and ran \nThe Sons of Liberty\n, a British opposition group. Helped to unite against Britain. Without Adams, it is likely that the Revolution we know today would never have existed.\n\n\nCommittees of Correspondence\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nOrganized by Samuel Adams, the first in 1772 Boston. They kept the British opposition alive and gave Adams a network to spread propoganda.\n\n\nJohn Hancock\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nSamuel Adams' financial backer. A \ntrader\n smuggler, Hancock was angered by British when they began enforcing the Navigation Acts (anti-smuggling) the Stamp Acts (caused him to pay more on imports) and others. He found Adams interesting as he was a great organizer, and Hancock decided to back him and his rebel group \nThe Sons of Liberty\n.\n\n\nBoston Massacre 1770\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nIn 1770, a clash between 60 townspeople and a squad of 10 redcoats led to 11 casualities. Samuel Adams called on Paul Revere to make an engraving of the incident and Adams circulated these all across the colonies, sparking anger against the British governments.\n\n\nBoston Tea Party 1773\n\n\nCause\n\n\nIn 1773, the British East India Company, facing bankruptcy, was given a monopoly of the American tea buisness. The corporation sold tea to the colonies at a cheaper rate than before, even with taxes. This angered John Hancock in particular, who was unable to sell his tea anymore. He and Saumel Adams rallied colonists against this, seeing it as a disguised tax. Thus, on December 16, 1773, colonists attacked tea ships in Boston Harbor and poured out all the tea into the harbor.\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nResulted in the \nIntolerable Acts\n\n\nIntolerable Acts of 1774\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nAfter the Boston Tea Party, Parliament responded with these Acts in an attempt to deal with the situation.\n\n\nActs: \n\n\n\n\nBoston Port Act: Closed the harbor until damages were paid back\n\n\nRestrictions were also placed on local town meetings\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuartering Act: Gave local authorities power to lodge British soldiers anywhere, even in private homes\n\n\nQuebec Act: \nMore Information\n\n\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nConsidered as the massacre of American Liberty. Also led to \nThe First Continental Congress\n in 1774. \n\n\nQuebec Act 1774\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nPassed with the \nIntolerable Acts of 1774\n, the Quebec Act was actually a good law. The law gave the French Canadians the right to Catholicism and the right to keep their old customs and instituions (which didn't allow trial by jury). Additionally, the law gave the province of Quebec the Ohio River as its new Southern boundary.\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nAmerican colonists were angered that the Canadians got land that they had planned to move into, and angered Anti-Catholics.\n\n\nFirst Continental Congress 1774\n\n\nOverview\n\n\n12/13 colonies met to address colonial grievances. Acted as a consultative body to decide what to do about the Intolerable Acts.\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nJohn and Samuel Adams moved a proposal for American home rule under British direction. The Congress also drew up several papers, including the Declaration of Rights and appeals to other colonies, the king, and the British people.\n\n\nThe biggest action was the creation of \nThe Association\n\n\nThe Association 1774\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nCalled for a complete boycott of British goods. A combination of nonimportation, nonexportation, and nonconsumption. However, this was not a call for independence, instead, the colonists simply wanted to call of the offensive taxation and return to the state of America before the French and Indian War.\n\n\nLexington/Concord 1775\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nIn response to the Association, the British commander in Boston sent troops in April 1775 to Lexington and Concord to steal colonial gunpoweder and capture Samuel Adams and John Hancock.\n\n\nAt Lexington, a group of \nMinute Men\n tried and failed to stop the British, resulted in 8 dead Americans. However, the British were forced to retreat at Concord, where a large force of Americans dealt 300 casualties to the British.\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nEffectively started the revolutionary war. \n\n\nBunker Hill 1775\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nThe first battle of the Revolutionary War, colonists seized Bunker Hill (Breed's Hill at the time) and mowed down advancing redcoats.\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nThe French began to look at the colonists as an actual force, King George abandoned all hope of reconcilliation (Despite the July 1775 \nOlive Branch Petition\n), and hired thousands of German troops (Hessians) in addition to British troops to fight the war in America. The hiring of German troops shocked the colonists, who felt that the war was a \"family matter\".\n\n\nThe Declaration of Independence (July 4, 1776)\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nAlso known as \"Jefferson's explanation of Independence\", this document was formal declaration of \nRichard Henry Lee\n's resolution.\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nAppealed universally and gave a long list of reasons on why the colonies were leaving, primarily to inform the French that they had nothing to fear in helping the colonies win independence.\n\n\nThomas Paine (Common Sense 1776)\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nBritish writer who wrote \nCommon Sense\n, an extremely influential pamphlet.\n\n\nContents\n\n\n\n\nStates only derive their powers from the consent of the governed.\n\n\nUnless America is independent, they cannot hope for foreign assistance\n\n\nCalled for creation of a \nrepublic\n, where power flowed from the people\n\n\nPromoted \ncitizen virtue\n, the concept that a citizen must sacrifice their personal needs for the collective good of a nation\n\n\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nAs a result of the pamplet, he effectively gave Washington an army by convincing enough people that there was a reason to fight.\n\n\nBattle of Saratoga 1777\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nOn October 17, 1777, British General John Burgoyne surrendered to American General Horatio Gates\n\n\nCause\n\n\nExplain this later, its pretty complicated\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nAt this point, the French were just waiting for one big victory by the colonists before they sent troops; this battle did that, and allowed Americans to get foreign aid. The victory itself was also an immense morale booster, and revived the faltering colonial cause.\n\n\nYorktown 1781\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nDecisive victory that effectively ended the Revolutionary War. \n\n\nCause\n\n\nCornwallis had retreated into the Chesapeake Bay at Yorktown at one of the few times during the war when the French controlled the seas. Admiral de Grasse covered the seas, General Washington and French General Rochambeau assaulted Cornwallis on land, forcing him to surrender on October 19, 1781.\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nSee the \nTreaty of Paris\n\n\nTreaty of Paris 1783\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nSigned in 1783, the Treaty of Paris officially ended the Revolutionary War.\n\n\nCause\n\n\nAfter the battle of Yorktown, the British were finally forced to draw an end to the war.\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nThe terms of the treaty were as followed:\n\n\n\n\nThe US gets all land from Mississippi (Western boundary) to the Great Lakes (Northern boundary) to Spanish Florida (Southern boundary).\n\n\nAmerica holds a share in the fisheries of Newfoundland (angered Canada)\n\n\nCongress must recommend state legislatures to return confiscated Loyalist property\n\n\nThe states must not put any legal obstacles in paying off debt",

The people there felt the tax was being imposed on a economic necesity (as whiskey was used as a form of payment). The protesters tarred and feathered revenue officers just as the original Revolutionaries had done.\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nWashington, not tolerating these \"self-created societies\", with Hamilton's encouragement, called up the militias of many states and crushed the rebellion. By using such a force, Washington gained a new respect for his government - but also some criticism at such massive use of force.\n\n\nHamilton and the Bank of the US\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nHamilton proposed a bank for the us that would be a powerful private institution of which the government would be the major stock holder and in which the Federal Treasury would deposit excess money. Thus, the central government would have a strongbox and also stimulate buisness by being in circulation. In addition, the bank would be able to print needed paper money.\n\n\nJefferson opposed completely, and said that only the states could charter banks (literal interpretation of the Constitution). Hamilton however, argued that Congress can pass out any laws to carry out the powers vested in various government agencies (Article I, Section VIII, Paragraph 18). Essentially, Hamilton argued that government had the power to collect taxes and regulate trade, and thus they could create this Bank. \n\n\nJay's Treaty\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nThis was a treaty that John Jay signed in order to keep peace with Great Britain.\n\n\nCause\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nWashington's Farewell\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nWashington's resignation speech which set several impotant precendents regarding power and international affairs.\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nTwo Terms\n: Washington only served for two terms, and thus every president except FDR (Fighting WWII needed a consistent voice) also did so.\n\n\nNo Intertangling Alliances\n: Washington argued that we should not make any permanent alliances without nations (looking at you, alliance with France). Washington did however approve \ntemporary\n alliances. This set US Foreign policy until WWII (That war changed a lot)\n\n\nAlien and Sediton Acts 1798\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nLaws passed under the John Adams administration that made it a crime to impede government policies or falsey defame its officials (Sedition) and gave the president the power to import or imprison immigrants during times of hostitility (Alien).\n\n\nCause\n\n\nThe Alien Act was passed to give more power with a war against France becoming more and more iminent. In addition, a significant portion of Jeffersonian Democrats were immigrants, and were opposing Adams.\n\n\nDuring his administration, Adams was often ridiculed, often by members of his own party (*ahem* \nAlexander Hamilton\n). In addition, at that time, the verbal violence was unrestrained, and many writers (some of them exiled aliens) sought out to destroy Adams. \n\n\nEffect\n\n\nThey increased Jeffersonian resentment to the laws and the Federalist system, especially because the Supreme Court refused to ruled against the laws (as the Court was very federalist).\n\n\nThis eventually resulted in the \nVirginia and Kentucky Resolutions\n.\n\n\nVirginia and Kentucky Resolutions 1798-1799\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nJefferson and Madison, angered by the Alien and Sedition Acts, wrote these resolutions that said that states were the final authority of whether the federal government overstepped its powers granted by the constitution. He said that therefore, if a state believed that the federal government had overpassed its power, it would have the power to \nnullify\n the law they find offensive. \n\n\nEffect\n\n\nStates Rights arguers will go back to this. Also, the concept of nullification will come back in the South Carolinian nullification crisis\n\n\nXYZ Affair\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nIncident in France in which Adams sent his diplomats (including John Marshall) to negotiate with French foreign minister Talleyrand about hostilities the US was facing after they had accepted Jay's Treaty. (The French were attacking US Ships and refused to accept the US Ambassador).\n\n\nHowever, once Adams' diplomats reached France, French agents X, Y, and Z (identities kept secret) demanded 32 million florins + $250,000 as a bribe to just talk to Talleyrand.\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nNegotiations broke down, and the diplomats were treated like heroes for not caving in. The slogan \"Millions for defense, but not one cent for tribute\" became popular.\n\n\nAlso, Jeffersonian Democrats, who had backed the French, took to the shadows as their Pro-French views suddenly became popular. \n\n\nWar Preperations\n\n\nAfter the affair, the government decided to start preparing for war. The Navy Department was created, Marine Corps were reestablished and the nation was about to fall into war, if it wasn't for Adams' wise choice to negotiate more with Talleyrand. At France, the \nConvention of 1800\n was signed, and the nations remained at peace. If Adams had not signed the treaty and instead went to war, he would have most likely won a second term. However, his willingness to peace likely helped Jefferson when he went to buy Louisiana just three years later.\n\n\nWashingtons First Cabnet\n\n\n\n\nJohn Adams\n: Vice President (Not actually part of the cabinet, but he's here)\n\n\nAlexander Hamilton\n: Secretary of the Treasury\n\n\nThomas Jefferson\n: Secretary of State\n\n\n\n\nNo one else matters :P, but here they are anyways:\n\n\n\n\nHenry Knox\n: Secretary of War (We call this 'Defense' today)\n\n\nEdmund Randolph\n: Attorney General\n\n\n\n\nBll of Rghts\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nCause\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nJudcary Act 1789\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nCause\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nPnckney Treaty 1795\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nCause\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nMarbury vs Madson\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nCause\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nThe Jeffersonan \"Revoluton of 1800\"\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nCause\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nLousana Purchase\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nCause\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nEmbargo Act 1807\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nCause\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nMacons Bll #2\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nCause\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nChesapeake Affar\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nCause\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nJudcary Act 1801\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nCause\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nLews and Clark\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nCause\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nNon-Intercourse Act\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nCause\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nNorthwest Ordnance of 1787\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nCause\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nNew Jersey Plan Connectcut Plan Ant-Federalsts\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nCause\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nTecumsehlTenskwatawa Treaty of Ghent Hartford Conventon Henry Clay James Madson Wllam Henry Harrson Battle of New Orleans The War Hawks\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nCause\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nHartford Conventon Olver Hazard Perry\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nCause\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nSecond Bank of the US Tarff of 1816 Panc 1819 McCulloch v Maryland Dartmouth v Woodward Cohens v Vrgna Gbbons v Ogden The Monroe Doctrne Danel Webster The \"North Amerca Revew\" James Monroe Amercan System Mssour Compromse JOhn Marshall Era of Good Feelngs\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nCause\n\n\nEffect\n\n\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nCause\n\n\nEffect\n\n\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nCause\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nLand Ordnance of 17 85 I\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nCause\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nShays\u2019 Rebellon\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nCause\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nVrgna Plan\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nCause\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nFederalsts\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nCause\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nThe Federalst Papers\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nCause\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nWhskey Rebellon\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nCause\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nHamlton and the Bank of US\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nCause\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nJ ay\u2019s Treaty\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nCause\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nWashngtons Farewell\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nCause\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nAlen and Sedton Acts\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nCause\n\n\nEffect\n\n\nKentucky 8;;

Jefferson opposed completely, and said that only the states could charter banks (literal interpretation of the Constitution).
