            <h1>Chapter 2 Test Review</h1>
          
          <h2 id="land-ordinance-of-1785">Land Ordinance of 1785</h2>
<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>Law that said the land of the old NW should be used to help pay off the national debt. Saod that the land would be divided into townships (and the 16th section of each town was to be made a school). </p>
<h3 id="related-northwest-ordinance-of-1787">Related: Northwest Ordinance of 1787</h3>
<p>Set rules for how a state could join the Union.
- Solved the problem that kings were trying to solve for a while</p>
<p>Said that a state could join if:</p>
<ol>
<li>It started off as a territory </li>
<li>The territory gained 60,000 inhabitants</li>
</ol>
<p>Important: The law also forbade slavery in the Old Northwest</p>
<h3 id="effect">Effect</h3>
<p>Saved America from another revolution, (The West against the East)
- If America had attempted to chain new territories in permanent subordination, there would have been an early CW</p>
<h2 id="virginia-plan">Virginia Plan</h2>
<h3 id="overview_1">Overview</h3>
<p>Reprentation in Congress should be based on represetntation. This conflicted directly with the <strong>New Jersey Plan</strong>, which called for equal represntation in Congress. </p>
<h3 id="effect_1">Effect</h3>
<p>The Great Compromise resulted in a bi-cameral legislature, in which there would be a Senate in which all states have equal representation and a House of Representatives where states would send delegates based on population.</p>
<p>This compromise plan was known as the Connecticut plan.</p>
<h2 id="federalists">Federalists</h2>
<h3 id="overview_2">Overview</h3>
<p>Believed in a strong federal government, supported the constitution. Eventually died out after the election of Thomas Jefferson. Their chief rival, the Anti-Federalists, evolved into the Jeffersonian Democratic-Republican party.</p>
<h3 id="important-federalists">Important Federalists</h3>
<ul>
<li>Alexander Hamilton -  Leader of the Party</li>
<li>George Washington - Though not officially a federalist, he backed most Federalist ideas as president</li>
<li>John Marshall - 4th Chief Justice of the US, kept Federalist ideas alive and well through the Supreme Court even when the Federalist Party was dead</li>
<li>James Madison - Wrote the Constituion, but became a Democratic-Republican later</li>
<li>John Adams -  2nd President of the USA, had a very unpopular presidency but his Federalist actions may have saved the country (Looking at you, early war with France)</li>
<li>John Jay - 1st Chief Justice</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-federalist-papers">The Federalist Papers</h2>
<h3 id="overview_3">Overview</h3>
<p>Collection of essays that discuss the need for the Constituion. They also explain how the Constituion will work, and are used to this day to interpret the Constitution</p>
<h3 id="authors">Authors</h3>
<ul>
<li>Alexander Hamilton</li>
<li>John Jay</li>
<li>James Madison</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="whiskey-rebellon-1794">Whiskey Rebellon 1794</h2>
<h3 id="overview_4">Overview</h3>
<p>Rebellion by poor famers against the federal government</p>
<h3 id="cause">Cause</h3>
<p>As part of his financial plan, implemented an excise tax on whiskey, which hurt many in south-western Pennsylvania. The people there felt the tax was being imposed on a economic necesity (as whiskey was used as a form of payment). The protesters tarred and feathered revenue officers just as the original Revolutionaries had done.</p>
<h3 id="effect_2">Effect</h3>
<p>Washington, not tolerating these "self-created societies", with Hamilton's encouragement, called up the militias of many states and crushed the rebellion. By using such a force, Washington gained a new respect for his government - but also some criticism at such massive use of force.</p>
<h2 id="hamilton-and-the-bank-of-the-us">Hamilton and the Bank of the US</h2>
<h3 id="overview_5">Overview</h3>
<p>Hamilton proposed a bank for the us that would be a powerful private institution of which the government would be the major stock holder and in which the Federal Treasury would deposit excess money. Thus, the central government would have a strongbox and also stimulate buisness by being in circulation. In addition, the bank would be able to print needed paper money.</p>
<p>Jefferson opposed completely, and said that only the states could charter banks (literal interpretation of the Constitution). Hamilton however, argued that Congress can pass out any laws to carry out the powers vested in various government agencies (Article I, Section VIII, Paragraph 18). Essentially, Hamilton argued that government had the power to collect taxes and regulate trade, and thus they could create this Bank. </p>
<h2 id="jays-treaty">Jay's Treaty</h2>
<h3 id="overview_6">Overview</h3>
<p>This was a treaty that John Jay signed in order to keep peace with Great Britain.</p>
<h3 id="cause_1">Cause</h3>
<h3 id="effect_3">Effect</h3>
<h2 id="washingtons-farewell">Washington's Farewell</h2>
<h3 id="overview_7">Overview</h3>
<p>Washington's resignation speech which set several impotant precendents regarding power and international affairs.</p>
<h3 id="effect_4">Effect</h3>
<p><strong>Two Terms</strong>: Washington only served for two terms, and thus every president except FDR (Fighting WWII needed a consistent voice) also did so.</p>
<p><strong>No Intertangling Alliances</strong>: Washington argued that we should not make any permanent alliances without nations (looking at you, alliance with France). Washington did however approve <em>temporary</em> alliances. This set US Foreign policy until WWII (That war changed a lot)</p>
<h2 id="alien-and-sediton-acts-1798">Alien and Sediton Acts 1798</h2>
<h3 id="overview_8">Overview</h3>
<p>Laws passed under the John Adams administration that made it a crime to impede government policies or falsey defame its officials (Sedition) and gave the president the power to import or imprison immigrants during times of hostitility (Alien).</p>
<h3 id="cause_2">Cause</h3>
<p>The Alien Act was passed to give more power with a war against France becoming more and more iminent. In addition, a significant portion of Jeffersonian Democrats were immigrants, and were opposing Adams.</p>
<p>During his administration, Adams was often ridiculed, often by members of his own party (*ahem* <strong>Alexander Hamilton</strong>). In addition, at that time, the verbal violence was unrestrained, and many writers (some of them exiled aliens) sought out to destroy Adams. </p>
<h3 id="effect_5">Effect</h3>
<p>They increased Jeffersonian resentment to the laws and the Federalist system, especially because the Supreme Court refused to ruled against the laws (as the Court was very federalist).</p>
<p>This eventually resulted in the <a href="#virginia-and-kentucky-resolutions-1798-1799">Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions</a>.</p>
<h2 id="virginia-and-kentucky-resolutions-1798-1799">Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions 1798-1799</h2>
<h3 id="overview_9">Overview</h3>
<p>Jefferson and Madison, angered by the Alien and Sedition Acts, wrote these resolutions that said that states were the final authority of whether the federal government overstepped its powers granted by the constitution. He said that therefore, if a state believed that the federal government had overpassed its power, it would have the power to <strong>nullify</strong> the law they find offensive. </p>
<h3 id="effect_6">Effect</h3>
<p>States Rights arguers will go back to this. Also, the concept of nullification will come back in the South Carolinian nullification crisis</p>
<h2 id="xyz-affair">XYZ Affair</h2>
<h3 id="overview_10">Overview</h3>
<p>Incident in France in which Adams sent his diplomats (including John Marshall) to negotiate with French foreign minister Talleyrand about hostilities the US was facing after they had accepted Jay's Treaty. (The French were attacking US Ships and refused to accept the US Ambassador).</p>
<p>However, once Adams' diplomats reached France, French agents X, Y, and Z (identities kept secret) demanded 32 million florins + $250,000 as a bribe to just talk to Talleyrand.</p>
<h3 id="effect_7">Effect</h3>
<p>Negotiations broke down, and the diplomats were treated like heroes for not caving in. The slogan "Millions for defense, but not one cent for tribute" became popular.</p>
<p>Also, Jeffersonian Democrats, who had backed the French, took to the shadows as their Pro-French views suddenly became popular. </p>
<h3 id="war-preperations">War Preperations</h3>
<p>After the affair, the government decided to start preparing for war. The Navy Department was created, Marine Corps were reestablished and the nation was about to fall into war, if it wasn't for Adams' wise choice to negotiate more with Talleyrand. At France, the <strong>Convention of 1800</strong> was signed, and the nations remained at peace. If Adams had not signed the treaty and instead went to war, he would have most likely won a second term. However, his willingness to peace likely helped Jefferson when he went to buy Louisiana just three years later.</p>
<h2 id="washingtons-first-cabnet">Washingtons First Cabnet</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>John Adams</strong>: Vice President (Not actually part of the cabinet, but he's here)</li>
<li><strong>Alexander Hamilton</strong>: Secretary of the Treasury</li>
<li><strong>Thomas Jefferson</strong>: Secretary of State</li>
</ul>
<p>No one else matters :P, but here they are anyways:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Henry Knox</strong>: Secretary of War (We call this 'Defense' today)</li>
<li><strong>Edmund Randolph</strong>: Attorney General</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="bill-of-rights">Bill of Rights</h2>
<h3 id="overview_11">Overview</h3>
<p>In order to pass the Constitution, the Federalists promised that a Bill of Rights would be added later. </p>
<p>James Madison, original author of the Constitution, decided to write the 10 amendments that would become the first 10 amendments of the Constitution and would be called "The Bill of Rights"</p>
<h2 id="judiciary-act-of-1789">Judiciary Act of 1789</h2>
<h3 id="overview_12">Overview</h3>
<p>Organized the Supreme Court (John Jay became Chief Justice), and also established the federal district and circuit courts and the office of attorney general.</p>
<h2 id="pinckneys-treaty-of-1795">Pinckney's Treaty of 1795</h2>
<h3 id="overview_13">Overview</h3>
<p>Treaty with Spain that gave the United States free navigation of the Mississippi, warehouse rights at New Orleans, and Western Florida.</p>
<h3 id="cause_3">Cause</h3>
<p>Jay's Treaty.</p>
<h2 id="marbury-vs-madson">Marbury vs Madson</h2>
<h3 id="overview_14">Overview</h3>
<p>A court case that decided that the Supreme Court of the United States had the final say on whether an act was constitutional.</p>
<h3 id="cause_4">Cause</h3>
<p>In his last days of the presidency, John Adams passed the Judidicary Act of 1801, which essentially filled the entire Justice branch of the government with Federalists. Jefferson, angry at this, threw the law out. However, William Marbury sued for his commission, and his case went to the Supreme Court. Chief Justice John Marshall, dismissed his case, but explained his ruling saying that the part of the Judiciary Act Marbury was basing his case on was unconstituional. This gave the Supreme Court the power of <strong>judicial review</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="effect_8">Effect</h3>
<p>Power went to federal government, not the states.</p>
<h2 id="the-jeffersonian-revoluton-of-1800">The Jeffersonian "Revoluton of 1800"</h2>
<h3 id="overview_15">Overview</h3>
<p>The election of Thomas Jefferson in 1800. </p>
<h3 id="significance">Significance</h3>
<p>The first peaceful transition of power in history</p>
<h2 id="lousiana-purchase">Lousiana Purchase</h2>
<h3 id="overview_16">Overview</h3>
<p>After Spain ceded Louisiana to France, Americans in the area lost the warehouse rights they gained from Pinckney's treaty, which hurt the frontier farmers who relied on this to make a living. Sensing potential problems (what if Napoleon tried to create an American Empire after Europe?), Jefferson sent Monroe to join Livingston in France to try to buy New Orleans. However, due to the <strong>Hatian Revolution</strong>, Napoleon had lost interest in a North American empire, and due to British pressure on him, Napoleon decided to keep America away from Britain's arms and sell Jefferson not just Louisiana, but the <strong>entire territory of Louisiana</strong>. Monroe and Livingston accepted, needless to say.</p>
<h3 id="problems">Problems</h3>
<p>While Jefferson liked the purchase, he could not help but feel that he had overstepped his authority as President, as he had only been given authority from Congress to buy the city of New Orleans (though Congress was happy to pay for all of Louisiana).</p>
<h3 id="effect_9">Effect</h3>
<p>Jefferson envisioned this new area as the "Valley of Democracy", that would allow for a great agrarian republic. The purchase also showed Washington's idea of avoiding entangling alliances, as Jefferson made the purchase without swearing loyalty to any countries in the process.</p>
<h2 id="embargo-act-1807">Embargo Act 1807</h2>
<h3 id="overview_17">Overview</h3>
<p>Due to war between Britain and France, both countries began stopping all trade going into the other country. America, which was trying to stay neutral, was losing many merchant ships to both countries, especially Great Britain, which was practicing <strong>impressment</strong> on American sailors and seizing American ships (France did too, not as much). Jefferson, believing that both countries relied heavily on American trade, decided that an embargo would convince both countries into working out a deal to trade with America.</p>
<h3 id="effect_10">Effect</h3>
<ol>
<li>The Embargo failed, and instead nearly destroyed the Northern economy (which completely relied on trade)<ul>
<li>This in turn led to the Hartford Convention</li>
<li>Also led to massive tarrifs after the war<ul>
<li>That led to the Nullification Crisis (South Carolina)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Macon's Bill #2 </li>
</ol>
<h2 id="macons-bill-2">Macon's Bill #2</h2>
<h3 id="overview_18">Overview</h3>
<p>Reopened trade with all countries, but if either France or Britain reopened commercial restrictions, the embargo would renact against that nation. (basically admitted that the US could not survive without either France or Britain)</p>
<h3 id="effect_11">Effect</h3>
<p>Napoleon vaguely told America that French restrictions may be removed if Britain removed theirs, which Madison gambled and accepted the note as French repeal and asked for Britain to remove their laws. However, Britain didn't , and the US had no choice but to put an embargo against Britain, thus ending American neutrality. (War)</p>
