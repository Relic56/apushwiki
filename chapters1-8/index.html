<h2 id="bacons-rebellion">Bacon's Rebellion</h2>
<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>Bacon's Rebellion was a rebellion in 1676 led by Nathaniel Bacon.</p>
<h3 id="cause">Cause</h3>
<p>The rebellion consisted of freedmen (ex-indentured servants) who were angry that they didn't get the land that they migrated for. In addition, due to a lack of single women in the colonies, they were unable to find wives.</p>
<h3 id="effect">Effect</h3>
<p>Fearful for another rebellion, the landed gentry of the South (Planter Class) began looking for an alternative source of labor. They settled on Africa, thus sparking the slave trade and the South's dependence on slave labor</p>
<h2 id="jamestown">Jamestown</h2>
<h3 id="overview_1">Overview</h3>
<p>Jamestown was the first British colony in America, founded in 1607 by the Virginia Company of England</p>
<h3 id="cause_1">Cause</h3>
<p>The joint-stock Virginia Company founded the colony looking for gold. </p>
<h3 id="effect_1">Effect</h3>
<p>Its charter guaranteed the overseas settlers the same rights that they would get if they stayed in England. This part of the charter was eventually extended to all of the colonies.</p>
<h2 id="peter-stuyvesant">Peter Stuyvesant</h2>
<h3 id="overview_2">Overview</h3>
<p>Peter Stuyvesant was a Dutch Directors-General who attacked the Swedish in New Sweden (Delaware).</p>
<h3 id="cause_2">Cause</h3>
<p>Angered that the Swedish trespassed on the Dutch preserves, the Dutch sent Peter to take out the Swedish forces in New Sweden (Delaware).</p>
<h3 id="effect_2">Effect</h3>
<p>The colonists of old New Sweden were absorbed into the New Netherlands, and the colony eventually became Delaware)</p>
<h2 id="new-england-confederation">New England Confederation</h2>
<h3 id="overview_3">Overview</h3>
<p>Founded in 1643 by the colonists of the Massachusets Bay Colonies and the Connecticut Colonies.</p>
<h3 id="cause_3">Cause</h3>
<p>The Confederation was formed during the English Civil War, in order to defend themselves against the Indians, French, and Dutch. Each colony only had two votes, which angered the populous Massachusets Colony. </p>
<h3 id="effect_3">Effect</h3>
<p>While it was extremely weak and Puritan exclusive, the Confederation was the first considerable milestone to colonial unity. From 1640-1660, when England went through its Civil War, the colonies operated on autonomy, which resulted in a independent culture in the Americas.  The Confederation was disbanded in the 1660s, when King Charles II took power. (Replaced with Dominion of New England)</p>
<h2 id="dominion-of-new-england">Dominion of New England</h2>
<h3 id="overview_4">Overview</h3>
<p>The Dominion of New England included New England, New York, and East and West Jersey</p>
<h3 id="cause_4">Cause</h3>
<p>In 1686, royal authority created the Dominion of New England to promote efficiency in the administration of the English Navigation Laws. This was part of an effort by the monarchy to tie the colonies closer to the motherland by restricting trade with only England. The Dominion was lead by Sir Edmund Andros, who heavily taxed the people and enforced the hated Navigation Laws, nearly caused a revolt within the colonies. The Dominion was disbanded after the Glorious Revolution in England of 1689.</p>
<h3 id="effect_4">Effect</h3>
<p>As a result of these laws, colonists turned to smuggling and colonists began to share similar sentiments against England.</p>
<h2 id="great-puritan-migration">Great Puritan Migration</h2>
<h3 id="overview_5">Overview</h3>
<p>Most likely a typo for great "english" migration.</p>
<h3 id="cause_5">Cause</h3>
<h3 id="effect_5">Effect</h3>
<h2 id="the-half-way-covenant-and-the-salem-witch-trials">The Half-Way Covenant and the Salem Witch Trials</h2>
<h3 id="overview_6">Overview</h3>
<p>The Salem Witch Trials were trials held across New England settlements prosecuting 'witches', who were actually mostly women from commerical families.</p>
<p>In the mid-seventeenth century, preachers began preaching jermiads, worried by declining religios devotion. In 1662, ministers announced the <b>Half Way Covenant</b>, which was a new form of Church membership that allowed the baptism of non-converted members.     </p>
<p>As a result of expanding Puritan membership, the link between the elect and the others broke, which further diluted the spiritual purity from the original Puritans. This eventually led to the Puritan Church opening its doors to everyone, led to and end of strict religious purity. Also led to an increase of women in the Puritan congregation, who came to make up the majority of churchgoers. This eventually lead into the Salem Witch trials, where most of the accused women came from Salem's growing market economy and the accusers came from the farming families in Salem. They reflected the widening social gaps of New England and the fear that Puritan Heritage was dying out to Yankee commericalism.</p>
<h2 id="headright-system">Headright System</h2>
<h3 id="overview_7">Overview</h3>
<p>Law that gave the right to acquire 50 acres of land if you pay the passage of an indentured servant.</p>
<h3 id="cause_6">Cause</h3>
<p>Virginia and Maryland passed this system in order to make it more favorable to bring in indentured servants to work the land, which would increase each colony's economy.</p>
<h3 id="effect_6">Effect</h3>
<p>The system greatly benefitted the masters who brought slaves to the New World, and they eventually became the great merchant-planters of the South, also known as the Planter Class. (Washington and many other of the founding fathers belonged to this class).</p>
<h2 id="indentured-servant">Indentured Servant</h2>
<h3 id="overview_8">Overview</h3>
<p>Indentured Servants were people who boarded ships to America, who voluntarily sold themselves to virtual slavery for a fixed amount of time in exchange for passage to the New World, and (maybe) land after they became free.</p>
<h3 id="cause_7">Cause</h3>
<p>Due to a "surplus" of men in England and a growing Tobacco industry in America, a demand for labor was sparked.</p>
<p><b>Why not African Slaves?</b></p>
<p>Since African slaves were more expensive and morality rates were high in the South (Primarily the Chesapeake), Africans were seen as a bad investment, and so the landowners turned to indentured servants instead.</p>
<h3 id="effect_7">Effect</h3>
<p>Led to an even more increased reliance on agriculture in the South. Eventually, after Bacon's Rebellion, the planters would turn to African slaves.</p>
<h2 id="triangular-trade">Triangular Trade</h2>
<h3 id="overview_9">Overview</h3>
<p>The trade between New England, Africa, and the West Indies.</p>
<p>New England gave rum, Africa took the rum for slaves, the West Indies gave molasses for the slaves, and the molasses went to New England for more rum.</p>
<h2 id="the-great-awakening-and-george-whitefield">The Great Awakening and George Whitefield</h2>
<h3 id="overview_10">Overview</h3>
<p>George Whitefiled was a famous preacher during the Great Awakening, and represented the ideas of great emotional preaching during the time.</p>
<h3 id="cause_8">Cause</h3>
<p>In the early 18th century, religion was sagging in the colonies. The Puritans in particular, were fighting against liberal ideas that suggested that not just the 'elect' get to go to heaven. <strong>Arminianism</strong>, the theology preached by Jacobus Arminius, preached that an individual's free will determined a person's eternal fate, and that all humans, not just the elect, could go to heaven if they accepted God's grace. A few Puritan churches accepted this, leading into more emotional packed sermons, also known as the <strong>Great Awakening</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="effect_8">Effect</h3>
<p>The Awakening's emphasis on direct, emotional spirituality damaged the authority of the older clergy, who had relied on their education for their authority. This lead to many more different churches and schisms in the religion. It also lead to the creation of American colleges like Princeton and Brown and others to promote higher learning and clergy training. Most importantly, the Awakening was the first mass movement of the American people, that united many of the American people.</p>
<h2 id="william-pitt">William Pitt</h2>
<h3 id="overview_11">Overview</h3>
<p>Also known as "The Great Commoner", William Pitt was a leader who in 1757 took power in the London government. Pitt's efforts ultimately resulted in victory in the French and Indian war.</p>
<h3 id="effect_9">Effect</h3>
<p>The end of the war resulted in Spain and England taking all of French territory, and England taking Spain, resulting in England as the dominant power in North America and as the leading naval power in the World.</p>
<h2 id="treaty-of-paris">Treaty of Paris</h2>
<h3 id="overview_12">Overview</h3>
<p>Signed in 1783, the Treaty of Paris officially ended the Revolutionary War.</p>
<h3 id="cause_9">Cause</h3>
<p>After the battle of Yorktown, the British were finally forced to draw an end to the war.</p>
<h3 id="effect_10">Effect</h3>
<p>The terms of the treaty were as followed:</p>
<ul>
<li>The US gets all land from Mississippi (Western boundary) to the Great Lakes (Northern boundary) to Spanish Florida (Southern boundary).</li>
<li>America holds a share in the fisheries of Newfoundland (angered Canada)</li>
<li>Congress must recommend state legislatures to return confiscated Loyalist property</li>
<li>The states must not put any legal obstacles in paying off debt</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="albany-congress-1754">Albany Congress 1754</h2>
<h3 id="overview_13">Overview</h3>
<p>Congress summoned by the British government to (short-term) keep the Iroquois loyal to the British and (long-term) unite the colonies together to create a common defense against the French.</p>
<h3 id="effect_11">Effect</h3>
<p>Another attempt for colonial unity, 7/13 colonies showed up.</p>
<h2 id="mercantilism">Mercantilism</h2>
<h3 id="overview_14">Overview</h3>
<p>The belief that a country's military and political power was measured by its wealth which was measured by the amount of gold or silver a country had. To acquire gold or silver a country needed to <strong>export more than it imported</strong>. Thus, owning colonies were strategic as they could supply raw materials and a guaranteed market to export to.</p>
<h3 id="effect_12">Effect</h3>
<p>As a result, the London government treated the Americans as tenants, and initially enforced laws like the Navigation Acts of 1650 to keep colonials only trading with Britain. However, the colonies eventually became so prosperous that the British stoppped bothering to enforce these laws as they were profitting so heavily off of colonial trade. However after the French and Indian War, the British treasury went bankrupt, forcing the British to enforce the laws again. This angered the colonials as they had been used to self-government under British <strong>salutary neglect</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="acts-of-1764-65">Acts of 1764-65</h2>
<h3 id="overview_15">Overview</h3>

<h2 id="committees-of-correspondence">Committees of Correspondence</h2>
<h3 id="overview_16">Overview</h3>
<p>Organized by Samuel Adams, the first in 1772 Boston. They kept the British opposition alive and gave Adams a network to spread propoganda.</p>
<h2 id="samuel-adams-get-back-to-him">Samuel Adams &lt;- Get back to him</h2>
<h3 id="overview_17">Overview</h3>
<h3 id="cause_10">Cause</h3>
<h3 id="effect_13">Effect</h3>
<h2 id="boston-massacre">Boston Massacre</h2>
<h3 id="overview_18">Overview</h3>
<p>In 1770, a clash between 60 townspeople and a squad of 10 redcoats led to 11 casualities. Samuel Adams called on Paul Revere to make an engraving of the incident and Adams circulated these all across the colonies, sparking anger against the British governments.</p>
<h2 id="quebec-act">Quebec Act</h2>
<h3 id="overview_19">Overview</h3>
<p>Passed with the <strong>Intolerable Acts of 1774</strong>, the Quebec Act was actually a good law. The law gave the French Canadians the right to Catholicism and the right to keep their old customs and instituions (which didn't allow trial by jury). Additionally, the law gave the province of Quebec the Ohio River as its new Southern boundary.</p>
<h3 id="effect_14">Effect</h3>

<h2 id="john-hancock">John Hancock</h2>
<h3 id="overview_20">Overview</h3>
<p>Samuel Adams' financial backer. A <del>trader</del> smuggler, Hancock was angered by British when they began enforcing the Navigation Acts (anti-smuggling) the Stamp Acts (caused him to pay more on imports) and others.

<h3 id="overview_21">Overview</h3>
<p>The first battle of the Revolutionary War, colonists seized Bunker Hill (Breed's Hill at the time) and mowed down advancing redcoats.</p>

<p>The French began to look at the colonists as an actual force, King George abandoned all hope of reconcilliation (Despite the July 1775 <strong>Olive Branch Petition</strong>), and hired thousands of German troops (Hessians) in addition to British troops to fight the war in America. The hiring of German troops shocked the colonists, who felt that the war was a "family matter".</p>
<h2 id="battle-of-saratoga">Battle of Saratoga</h2>
<h3 id="overview_22">Overview</h3>
<p>On October 17, 1777, British General John Burgoyne surrendered to American General Horatio Gates</p>
<h3 id="cause_11">Cause</h3>
<p>Explain this later, its pretty complicated</p>
<h3 id="effect_16">Effect</h3>
<p>At this point, the French were just waiting for one big victory by the colonists before they sent troops; this battle did that, and allowed Americans to get foreign aid. The victory itself was also an immense morale booster, and revived the faltering colonial cause.</p>
<h2 id="the-declaration-of-independence-july-4-1776">The Declaration of Independence (July 4, 1776)</h2>

<h3 id="effect_22">Effect</h3>
<p>By 1612, Rolfe had perfected methods of raising tobacco, and started selling it to Europe. Soon, the demand became so strong that almost all colonists switched to growing tobacco and began looking for more land. This led to more expansion against Native American land.
