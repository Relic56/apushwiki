#Chapters 1 - 8

##Bacon's Rebellion

###Overview

Bacon's Rebellion was a rebellion in 1676 led by Nathaniel Bacon.
###Cause
The rebellion consisted of freedmen (ex-indentured servants) who were angry that they didn't get the land that they migrated for. In addition, due to a lack of single women in the colonies, they were unable to find wives.

###Effect
Fearful for another rebellion, the landed gentry of the South (Planter Class) began looking for an alternative source of labor. They settled on Africa, thus sparking the slave trade and the South's dependence on slave labor

##Jamestown

###Overview

Jamestown was the first British colony in America, founded in 1607 by the Virginia Company of England

###Cause
The joint-stock Virginia Company founded the colony looking for gold. 
###Effect
Its charter guaranteed the overseas settlers the same rights that they would get if they stayed in England. This part of the charter was eventually extended to all of the colonies.


##Peter Stuyvesant

###Overview
Peter Stuyvesant was a Dutch Directors-General who attacked the Swedish in New Sweden (Delaware).
###Cause
Angered that the Swedish trespassed on the Dutch preserves, the Dutch sent Peter to take out the Swedish forces in New Sweden (Delaware).
###Effect
The colonists of old New Sweden were absorbed into the New Netherlands, and the colony eventually became Delaware)

## New England Confederation

###Overview
Founded in 1643 by the colonists of the Massachusets Bay Colonies and the Connecticut Colonies.
###Cause
The Confederation was formed during the English Civil War, in order to defend themselves against the Indians, French, and Dutch. Each colony only had two votes, which angered the populous Massachusets Colony. 

###Effect
While it was extremely weak and Puritan exclusive, the Confederation was the first considerable milestone to colonial unity. From 1640-1660, when England went through its Civil War, the colonies operated on autonomy, which resulted in a independent culture in the Americas.  The Confederation was disbanded in the 1660s, when King Charles II took power. (Replaced with Dominion of New England)

##Dominion of New England

###Overview
The Dominion of New England included New England, New York, and East and West Jersey
###Cause
In 1686, royal authority created the Dominion of New England to promote efficiency in the administration of the English Navigation Laws. This was part of an effort by the monarchy to tie the colonies closer to the motherland by restricting trade with only England. The Dominion was lead by Sir Edmund Andros, who heavily taxed the people and enforced the hated Navigation Laws, nearly caused a revolt within the colonies. The Dominion was disbanded after the Glorious Revolution in England of 1689.
###Effect
As a result of these laws, colonists turned to smuggling and colonists began to share similar sentiments against England.

##The Half-Way Covenant and the Salem Witch Trials

###Overview
The Salem Witch Trials were trials held across New England settlements prosecuting 'witches', who were actually mostly women from commerical families.

In the mid-seventeenth century, preachers began preaching jermiads, worried by declining religios devotion. In 1662, ministers announced the <b>Half Way Covenant</b>, which was a new form of Church membership that allowed the baptism of non-converted members. 	

As a result of expanding Puritan membership, the link between the elect and the others broke, which further diluted the spiritual purity from the original Puritans. This eventually led to the Puritan Church opening its doors to everyone, led to and end of strict religious purity. Also led to an increase of women in the Puritan congregation, who came to make up the majority of churchgoers. This eventually lead into the Salem Witch trials, where most of the accused women came from Salem's growing market economy and the accusers came from the farming families in Salem. They reflected the widening social gaps of New England and the fear that Puritan Heritage was dying out to Yankee commericalism.

## Headright System

###Overview
Law that gave the right to acquire 50 acres of land if you pay the passage of an indentured servant.
###Cause
Virginia and Maryland passed this system in order to make it more favorable to bring in indentured servants to work the land, which would increase each colony's economy.
###Effect
The system greatly benefitted the masters who brought slaves to the New World, and they eventually became the great merchant-planters of the South, also known as the Planter Class. (Washington and many other of the founding fathers belonged to this class).

##  Indentured Servant

###Overview
Indentured Servants were people who boarded ships to America, who voluntarily sold themselves to virtual slavery for a fixed amount of time in exchange for passage to the New World, and (maybe) land after they became free.
###Cause
Due to a "surplus" of men in England and a growing Tobacco industry in America, a demand for labor was sparked.

<b>Why not African Slaves?</b>

Since African slaves were more expensive and morality rates were high in the South (Primarily the Chesapeake), Africans were seen as a bad investment, and so the landowners turned to indentured servants instead.
###Effect
Led to an even more increased reliance on agriculture in the South. Eventually, after Bacon's Rebellion, the planters would turn to African slaves.
