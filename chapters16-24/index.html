<h3 id="freeport-doctrine">Freeport Doctrine</h3>
<p>At the second debate in Freeport, Illinois, Douglas answered the <strong>Freeport Question</strong>. ("If the people of a territory vote down slavery, do the people's decision take priority of the Supreme Court ruling on Dred Scott?"), and said that slavery would stay down if the people voted so (ie the supremacy of popular sovereignty). This answer proved to destroy his popularity in the South and led to the splitting of the Democratic Party in 1860.</p>
<h3 id="effects_1">Effects</h3>
